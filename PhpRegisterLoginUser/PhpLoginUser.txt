We have a registration form and we need to check  if our username and password 
matches our table username and password of any user. we have to do steps:
1. if(isset($_POST['submit'])) - if submit button is clicked

2. save username and password in variables.
$username=$_POST['username'];  //$_POST is an array. $_POST = array('username'=>username)...     
$password=$_POST['password']; 

3. check if registration fields are empty or not
if(empty($username) || empty($password))

4. check if input parameters matches database user parameters
We have to find user, that has username of $username, and password 
of $password, so we have to execute mysql command from our php code.

if our username matches username in database,compare passwords afterwards.

5.
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"; 
Prepare a SQL statement to select user data based on the username provided.

6.
$stmt = mysqli_stmt_init($conn); 
Initialize a MySQLi statement object. conn is argument because we should check which database we need to connect 

7.
if(!mysqli_stmt_prepare($stmt, $sql))
check if there was some errors while executing mysql code

8.
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "s", $username);
when we wrote command $sql, our username was '?', now, we change it to real username

9.
now, execute statement that we prepared. This sends the SQL query to the MySQL database
for execution, using the provided username as a parameter.
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);

10.
$result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);

11.
if($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result))
after this command, the result will be an associative
$row = array(
    'id' => id that username has,
    'username' => 'username that was found',
    'password' => 'some hashed password'
);



12.
check if passwords match
$passCheck = password_verify($password, $row['password']);
