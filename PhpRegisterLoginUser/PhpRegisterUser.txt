1. To Register User, We should check if we clicked on submit button and save username, password, confirmPassword
if(isset($_POST['submit']))
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];
$confirmPass = $_POST['confirmPassword'];

2. We have to check if the fields are empty or not
if(empty($username) || empty($password) || empty($confirmPass))

3.We have to check if username has invalid symbols 
elseif(!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*/",$username))

4.We have to check if password and confirm password matches or not
elseif($password!==$confirmPass)

5.Now we have to write information in database
$sql="SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = ?";

6.$stmt = mysqli_stmt_init($conn); 
Initialize a MySQLi statement object. conn is argument because we should check which database we need to connect 

7.if(!mysqli_stmt_prepare($stmt, $sql))
check if there was some errors while executing mysql code

8.mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "s", $username);
when we wrote command $sql, our username was '?', now, we change it to real username

9.now, execute statement that we prepared. This sends the SQL query to the MySQL database
for execution, using the provided username as a parameter.
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);

10.now, we have to store the result on the client side
mysqli_stmt_store_result() is used to buffer the result set on the client side, enabling to work
with the result set in various ways without needing to re-execute the prepared statement.
mysqli_stmt_store_result($stmt);

11.check if username already exist or not
$rowCount=mysqli_stmt_num_rows($stmt);
if ($rowCount>0)

12. if username is not taken, create new user in table
$sql="INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)";

13.$stmt = mysqli_stmt_init($conn); 
Initialize a MySQLi statement object. conn is argument because we should check which database we need to connect 

14.if(!mysqli_stmt_prepare($stmt, $sql))
check if there was some errors while executing mysql code

15.hash the password
$hashedPass = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

16.bind username and password to our statement
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "ss",$username,$hashedPass); 

17.execute the sql command
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
